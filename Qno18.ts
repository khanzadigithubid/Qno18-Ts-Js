/*.Seeing the World: Think of at least five places in the world
 you’d like to visit.
• Store the locations in a array. Make sure the array is not in 
alphabetical order.
• Print your array in its original order.
• Print your array in alphabetical order without modifying the 
actual list.
• Show that your array is still in its original order by printing
 it.
• Print your array in reverse alphabetical order without changing
 the order of the original list.
• Show that your array is still in its original order by printing
 it again.
• Reverse the order of your list. Print the array to show that 
its order has changed.
• Reverse the order of your list again. Print the list to show 
it’s back to its original order.
• Sort your array so it’s stored in alphabetical order. Print the
 array to show that its order has been changed.
• Sort to change your array so it’s stored in reverse 
alphabetical order. Print the list to show that its order has 
changed.*/
